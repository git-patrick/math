OPTIONS FOR MAKING THE NUMERIC INTEGRAL MORE ACCURATE,
complex integral



taylor expansion

the infinitesimal values in infinitesimal_tag cast operators were basically pulled out of a hat.
I need to think about them and choose logically.

think about specializing 1x1 matrices for performance?

	DERIVATIVE / COMPLEX DERIVATIVE X
	dihedral group  X
	symmetric group
	function description X
	derivative X
	compile time creation of analytic / holomorphic function - partially complete

	determinant of my matrix class, going to use symmetric group permutations.
	inverse of matrix class - going to use determinant

	limits
	
	
	
things I really want to get to:
	really want to go over manifolds and more topology



fix the iterator adjuster / iterator.h / iterator_range.h stuff.
